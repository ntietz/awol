# AWOL: Anywhere Wake-on-LAN

One day, I learned about [WoL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN). Unfortunately, the clients I installed would only work on the local network, which doesn't work for my use case of going AWOL and still being able to remotely turn on my desktop. Fortunately, the protocol is really simple!

To use this, compile it, run it with no args, and check the usage ðŸ˜‰

Yes, this README is a stub. It needs work. I'm sorry.
